# Calculator
Typical calculator app with an intuitive GUI: can add, subtract, multiply and divide.

Floats are functional.

The calculator evaluates an equation between two numbers at a time. If a user presses another sign, the current operation is immediately completed and the result is displayed, and immediately followed by the most recently pressed sign.
